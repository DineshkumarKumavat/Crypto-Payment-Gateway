# 🪙 Crypto Payment Gateway

A secure and simple **Ethereum-based Crypto Payment Gateway** for e-commerce applications. This project enables users to purchase products using cryptocurrency, with added transaction security using `keccak256` hashing. The system is tested locally with **Ganache** and **MetaMask**.

## 🚀 Features

- 💳 Accepts crypto payments for products.
- 🧠 Built with a **single smart contract** for handling payments.
- 🔐 Extra security with `keccak256` hashing of transaction data.
- 🧾 Tracks payment history and displays transaction details.
- 🛍️ Includes a basic product catalog (frontend demo).
- 🔌 Integrates with **MetaMask** for seamless payment.
- 🧪 Tested on **Ganache** (local Ethereum blockchain).

## 🧱 Smart Contract

The core of the gateway is a single Solidity smart contract that:

- Accepts and logs payments.
- Verifies transaction data using `keccak256` for added integrity.
- Emits payment events for frontend integration.
